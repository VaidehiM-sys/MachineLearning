# Machine Learning
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms using various datasets and observations regarding them.

## 1. Linear Regression using normal equation and gradient descent

  A linear regression model that predicts the GPAs of university students from two features, Math SAT and Verb SAT. 
  a) Training the model using Normal Equation method.
  b) Training the model using Gradient Descent method.
  c) Play arounding with different learning rate alpha for the model


## 2. Logistic Regression using Sign Languages data 

a) Implementation of Sigmoid function
b) Parameter Initialization and forward and backward computation
c) Implemntation of Gradient Descent and function to predict
d) Evaluation Matrix Calculation

## 3.  Support Vector Machine

A toy SVM model using mini dataset, computation of Q matrix and solving equation for decision boudary

## 4. Shallow Neural Network

Implementation of a 2-layer shallow neural network model. Use of a model to conduct the same binary classification task, i.e., classify two categories of the sign language dataset. The input size is the number of pixels in a image 64*64. The size of hidden layer is determined by a hyperparameter n_h, and the size of output layer is 1.


## 5. Deep Neural Network

Implementation of the Deep Neural Network with following structure
